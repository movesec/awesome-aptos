## Move

- [Awesome Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move) - Resource list maintained by MystenLabs, we drew much inspiration from here and copied several resources here for easy access.
- [Move Book](https://move-language.github.io/move/) - Introductory e-book to Move by the official team
- [The Move Book](https://move-book.com/) - E-book to learn Move by the community 

## Reference Smart Contracts
- [Aubrium Uniswap V2 implementation](https://github.com/pentagonxyz/xyk-amm-move/blob/main/aptos/sources/xyk_amm.move) - Uniswap V2 implemented in Move, great to understand Aptos if you come from ETH and know the solidity Uniswap V2 implementation
- [Pancakeswap MasterChef](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-contracts-move/blob/main/pancake-masterchef/sources/masterchef.move) - A reference MasterChef implementation (slightly bloated)
